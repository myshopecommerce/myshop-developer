Scripts and documentation useful for developers working on myshop applications (plugins)

Looking to develop scripts meant for a single shop, but not implemented as a plugin in the myshop.com marketplace?
In that case please look at the example scripts found here: https://github.com/myshopecommerce/myshop-examples

The following scripts are available:

-- MyshopRequest.php
   Helper for reading the request coming from myshop.com when a plugin is viewed inside the backoffice of myshop.com

-- helloWorld.php
   Gives an example of how to use myshopRequest.php

-- MyshopRpcClient.php
   Helper for using the myshop.com RPC functions / API
